# Insight Loom

Welcome to **Insight Loom**, an anonymous platform designed for sharing insights and opinions among a group of people. This platform facilitates open discussions, encouraging users to contribute valuable information while focusing on the subject instead of an individual.

## Motivation

The motivation behind Insight Loom is to create a space for open discussions and knowledge sharing within an industry. By allowing users to share insights anonymously, the aim is to encourage transparency and collaboration, breaking down barriers that may exist in traditional communication channels.

## Tech Stack

Insight Loom is built using the **MERN stack**:

- **MongoDB**: Database for storing insights, comments, and user data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling API requests and business logic.
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally using Docker, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

and, then visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.
